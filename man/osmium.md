--version
:   Show program version.

:   filter changesets from OSM changeset files

check-refs
:   check referential integrity of OSM file

derive-changes
:   create OSM change file from two OSM files

diff
:   display differences between OSM files

extract
:   create geographical extracts from an OSM file

# COMMON OPTIONS

Most commands support the following options:

-h, --help
:   Show short usage information.

-v, --verbose
:   Set verbose mode. The program will output information about what it is
    doing to *stderr*.


# MEMORY USAGE

Osmium commands try to do their work as memory efficient as possible. But some
osmium commands still need to load quite a bit of data into main memory. In
some cases this means that only smaller datasets can be handled. Look into the
man pages for the individual commands to learn more about their memory use.

If you use the **-v**, **--verbose** option on most commands they will print
out their peak memory usage at the end. This is the actual amount of memory
used including the program code itself, any needed libraries and the data.
(Printing of memory usage is currently only available on Linux systems.)

If an osmium command exits with an "Out of memory" error, try running it with
**--verbose** on smaller datasets to get an idea how much memory it needs.
