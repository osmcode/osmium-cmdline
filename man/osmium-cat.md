# NAME

osmium-cat - concatenate OSM files and convert to different formats


# SYNOPSIS

**osmium cat** \[*OPTIONS*\] *OSM-FILE*...


# DESCRIPTION

Concatenates all input files and writes the result to the output file. The data
is not sorted in any way but strictly copied from input to output.

Because this program supports several different input and output formats, it
can be used to convert OSM files from one format into another.

This commands reads its input file(s) only once and writes its output file
in one go so it can be streamed, ie. it can read from STDIN and write to
STDOUT.


# OPTIONS

-t, --object-type=TYPE
:   Read only objects of given type (*node*, *way*, *relation*, *changeset*).
    By default all types are read. This option can be given multiple times.
